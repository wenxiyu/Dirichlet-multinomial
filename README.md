# Dirichlet-multinomial
This is a course project for Biostats M280 taught by Dr. Hua Zhou at UCLA. 

This project focuses on digit classification using Dirichlet-multinomial models with Expectation-maximization (EM) and Majorize-minimization (MM) algorithms. 

Codes are written in the Julia Programming Language.
